                “EDUCATION IS THE CROWN OF LIFE.”
                Education helps the children to shape their life and mould their future. Therefore we give importance to
                the children through education. We give first preference to discipline next to the education. We
                organized seminar in order to develop the children in their character and behavior. At the same juncture
                we give importance to the extracurricular activities like Bharathanatyam, Karate, Yoga and music.’’
                Health is Wealth.’ Along the other subjects we give importance to the physical education. So the
                children are well motivated with delightfully to have the bright future through the various activities.
