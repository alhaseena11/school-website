        <p class="absp">Sports and games are important for all-round development and are an important part of our
                routine. Moreover, along with routine education, they help to shape our personalities. They keep our
                bodies strong, healthy, and fit. It gives us a change from the same old routine and relaxes our mind and
                body. Moreover, it is important because it is a useful means of entertainment as well as a way to do
                physical activity. It also makes the person with mental and physical toughness by shaping the body and

                energy and strength. Every year we celebrate sports meet in our campus and invite some personalities to
                encourage our students and to distribute prizes for the winners.</p>
